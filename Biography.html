            <h2>Schopenhauer's family</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>His father Heinrich Flores Schopenhauer was a wealthy businessman, and his mother Johanna Schopenhauer was a famous writer at that time. She had contacts with great literary giants such as Goethe. Her sister Adele later became a well-known writer and paper-cut artist. Schopenhauer had a bad relationship with his mother. He believed that there was an inseparable relationship between his father's death and his mother's pursuit of her own pleasure, so the gap between them was very deep, which eventually led to the breakdown of the relationship. But since he inherited his father's property, he lived a rich life. After death, Schopenhauer donated all his property to charity.</li>
            <li>Schopenhauer's pessimism is sometimes considered to be caused by his family. His father is irritable and melancholy, and his mother is selfish and indifferent.</li>
        </ul>
